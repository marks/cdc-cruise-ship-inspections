Writing code is much more fun than writing documentation.. this README will eventually be written.

For now, see https://github.com/demand-driven-open-data/ddod-intake/issues/11 for why this exists

Visit the `.ipynb` python notebook to see code and the `data/` folder for, you guessed it, data.

If you have any questions, you can tweet me @skram or email mark.silverberg@socrata.com
